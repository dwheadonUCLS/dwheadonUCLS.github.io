        <td>number system base</td>
        <td>the factor by which the place values in a number system increase by (all number systems start at 1)</td>
        <td>decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal</td>
        <td>In decimal, the base is 10 so place values are 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.; In binary, the base is 2 so place values are 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>place value</td>
        <td>a spot in a number system to hold a place</td>
        <td>In the number 435: the 4 is in the 100's place, 3 is in the ten's place and 5 is in the one's place</td>
        <td>Even if there's nothing in the place value, you need to put a zero to "hold the place"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>decimal</td>
        <td>base 10: the number system that humans use. Digits go from 0 to 9</td>
        <td>1234: one-thousand, two-hundred, thirty, four</td>
        <td>This is what humans have always used (perhaps because we have 10 fingers). We assume that any number is in base 10 unless otherwise stated but we can make it explicit with the "0d" prefix.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>binary</td>
        <td>base 2: the number system that computers use: digits go from 0 to 1</td>
        <td>0b1011: one-eight, no-four, one-two, one-one: equivalent to the 0d11</td>
        <td>Computers use this because it makes the electronics easier to build. We know it's binary because of the "0b" prefix.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>hexadecimal</td>
        <td>base 16: the number system that humans use to read binary data. Digits go from 0 to F (15)</td>
        <td>0xA90C: ten-4096's, nine-256's, no-16's, twelve-one's</td>
        <td>Humans use this because it's easy to translate from binary and it's a lot more compact</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ASCII</td>
        <td>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</td>
        <td>65 is the capital "A"</td>
        <td>The order doesn't matter as long as everyone knows and uses the STANDARD.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>lumens</td>
        <td>a measure of the brightness of a light</td>
        <td>A standard flashlight puts out about 300 lumens</td>
        <td>Multiple light sources cna be combined to provide incrementally more light</td>

        <td>Color channel</td>
        <td>Colors are physically created by a combination of 3 primary colors each or which represents one channel</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>The colors used for computer screens are red, green, and blue</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BPC</td>
        <td>Bits Per Color</td>
        <td>Most modern JPG images use a 24-bit color which makes for 8-bits per channel (8 for red, 8 for green, 8 for blue)</td>
        <td>If the number of bits per pixel cannot be divided evenly by three, the color is typically represented as a greyscale image instead.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>variable</td>
        <td>a name which represents a value</td>
        <td>the variable "age" has a value of 8</td>
        <td>The value of a variable can "vary" over time. Once they are assigned a new value, the old value is lost.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>function</td>
        <td>a process which takes a value as input and returns a value as output</td>
        <td>This is a common thing in mathematics: f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 4: here the input is some number "x" and the output is the value that the equation produces when x is replaced by that value</td>
        <td>In mathematics, a function is a little more strictly defined. In computer science, a function need not have an input and may not produce an output.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>syntax</td>
        <td>the rules that must be followed to produce valid code</td>
        <td>every open parenthesis must be matched by a close parenthesis</td>
        <td>If a code does not follow the correct syntax, a syntax error will be produced when you try to run the code. The error is often quite helpful for identifying what is wrong but can sometimes be misleading.</td>
